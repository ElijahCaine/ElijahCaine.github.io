# elijahcaine.github.io

This is repo behind [elijahcaine.github.io](https://elijahcaine.github.io/).

## Usage

The `source` branch contains the code behind static site. Instructions for
building the site are listed below.

The `master` branch contains the static content generated by the `source`
branch. This branch's content is auto generated by the `gh-build.sh` script.

**Note:** The build script involves moving files to `/tmp/` and then back into
the `master` branch.

### Building Content

The site is generated using the python static site generated
[acrylamid](https://posativ.org/acrylamid/). Any questions about the
configuration and structure oddities should be investigated in the acrylamid
documentation.

```
$ virtualenv -p python2 .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
[... pip installation output ...]
$ acrylamid autocompile
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
[... acrylamid build output ...]
```

This will re-build new changes as they are made. You can access a live version
of the site in your browser at localhost:8000.

### Building CSS

The CSS is generated using the [`sass` rubygem](http://sass-lang.com/). You can
edit the stylsheet `theme/style.scss`.

```
$ gem install --local sass
$ sass --watch theme/style.scss:theme/style.css
```

### Editing Theme

The theme is written using [jinja tempalates](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). All
theme content lives under the `theme/` directory. If you've worked with jinja
before it's pretty self explanatory, if you haven't it's a quick trade to pick
up.
