Open Source Contributions
=========================

I consider it an ethical duty to contribute to Open Source in any way one is
able to.  The idea of 'contribution' can take many forms, from reporting bugs,
to contributing code, to editing documentation.

To more efficiently humble-brag about how I spend the limited free time I have
compiled a list of *notable* Open Source project contributions I have made.
These are projects which I was not paid to work on and which I did not start
myself.
