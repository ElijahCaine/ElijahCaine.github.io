I am currently making my way through `The Stand`_ by `Stephen King`_.  I opted
to get the 1990's updated version because I figure if I was already going to
read 823 pages I might as well read the 200 more he added -- and enjoy the 90's
pop culture references instead of stale old 80's references!  About 100 pages
in I like it a lot.  Atmosphere building at it's best.
