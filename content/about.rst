I have been employed by the OSU Open Source Lab as a developer since the spring
of 2014. In that time I have been able to do a ton of great things including:

* Attend and present at conferences.
* Learn vital development skills for my career
* Mentor other OSL devs and Google Summer of Code students.
* Work with some very smart and interesting people.

Projects I have worked on at the lab include:

* `Timesync-Node`_, as an API designer and implementer.
* `Protein Geometry Database`_, as a codebase maintainer and GSOC mentor.
* `Devops Bootcamp`_, as a curriculum designer and teacher.

I have been a devoted member of the `Oregon State University Linux Users
Group`_ my freshman year in 2013.

In 2014 I was elected LUG President and have since devoted time, energy, and
resources into making a great club even better. We host events such as:

* **Install Festival** in which we help new and veteran Linux users install and use
  Linux in a Virtual Machine, Dual Boot, in the Cloud, or in a full
  installation.
* **speakers and presentations** including hosting a `CoreOS`_
  recruiting event, and various 'Practice Run' talks people give before
  presenting at large conferences.
* **Hackathons** at which we spend an hour furiously typing to solve coding riddles
  and conundrums for a grand prize of *stickers*.
* **Languages Night** where we host a round-table discussion about Open Source
  Software, Programming, and LUG related topics at large.

If you are interested in attending, check out the `LUG website`_ for time and
location details. If you would like to hang out with our community online,
check out the ``#osu-lug`` IRC channel on Freenode.

Software Development
--------------------

Below is a curated list of notable development projects I have worked on:

`TimeSync-Node`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `NodeJS`_ based project for keeping track of time for internal and externally
funded projects at the `Open Source Lab`_. Uses `ExpressJS`_, `KnexJS`_
libraries and a `Postgres`_ backend.

My part in this project was largely in the design of the `TimeSync API`_ and in
the implementation of the actual backends; myself and a team of coworkers
worked on this part time to get it implemented in about six months, including a
full unit-test suite, compatibility with sqlite, and a thorough set of
documentation.

`HuRandom`_
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Python `Flask`_ webapp with a `Sqlite`_ backend built to collect data in the
pursuit of answering the question "When people think of a *random number* what
do they usually come up with?"

The short answer: Usually something between 1 and 100.

`go-to-zzz`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simple `Golang`_ application for calculating when one should go to sleep. Not
the most exciting application on the planet, but it gave me an excute to write
some Go.

Extra-Curricular Work

Slides
~~~~~~

I give talks at conferences sometimes. I have every intention of posting the
slides from those talks on this page. Unfortunately that has not happened yet.

It'll happen eventually. I promise.

Reading
~~~~~~~

I am currently making my way through `The Stand`_ by `Stephen King`_.  I opted
to get the 1990's updated version because I figure if I was already going to
read 823 pages I might as well read the 200 more he added -- and enjoy the 90's
pop culture references instead of stale old 80's references!  About 100 pages
in I like it a lot.  Atmosphere building at it's best.
