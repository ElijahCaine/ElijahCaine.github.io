Experience
----------

This is definitely a place made for people like me.  Six of the nine occupied
tables were were held by somebody working silently on a laptop.  The music was
loud enough to hear but not abrasive; I could easy tune out what was playing
with my headphones at a reasonable volume, but I actually liked their selection
of hip-hop so I opted to soak in the atmosphere rather than isolating myself.

The seating mostly consisted of one long wooden wall-bench servicing six small
tables, each paired with one chair.  The wooden seating didn't feel
uncomfortable but I wouldn't say I could sit there for a full work day.

My time was cut short by the IRS shaking me down over the phone. Oh wait, did I
say the IRS? I meant some asshole scammers.  Here's that story, because why not?

The IRS Scam Story
------------------

**The scene:** The Fresh Pot Cafe, Thursday afternoon.  Not loud but not quiet
either.  I get a call from ``(360) 208-0783`` with a robotic voice claiming
something along the lines of *"You are being super-audited. The IRS is going to
rip you a financial new one unless you call back asap"*.  I am not jaded *yet*
so I call back right away.

I end up reaching a man with an Indian accent claiming to be...  let me check
my notes... "Officer Victor Brown" of the IRS with the badge ID "VK2019".  I
didn't transcribe his entire script, but he basically said that because of some tax
fraud I had committed the IRS was:

#. Suing me
#. Sending people to arrest me
#. Going to freeze my bank accounts soon

All for offenses between "the years of 2010 and 2015" adding up to the hefty sum
of $1857, and of course I couldn't resolve this issue unless I talked
directly with his manager.  If I chose not to talk to his manager, I wouldn't be
able to do anything and I would definitely still get super-audited. He made
this whole manager thing *very* clear.

At this point there were a few red flags going off in my head:

- Why didn't I hear about this earlier?
- Why did it sound like he was in a call center?
- Wait, what? I didn't even pay taxes in 2010, 2011, **or** 2012?

This all seemed like a pretty big hullabaloo for two grand, but I naively agreed
to talk with "Victor's" manager. Also with an *heavy* Indian accent, "Kevin
Butler" did not provide a badge ID. My assumption, of course, being that this was
*the* Kevin Butler, the man who needed no introduction nor badge.  You know...
*Kevin "The Audit Master of the North" Butler*.

This man then went on to give approximately the same spiel citing IRS Tax Code
violations like "13" and other intimidating numbers. At this point I was
walking out the door to some place quieter. I was at about 65% confidence that
this was a scam but needed to concentrate on the conversation to get to 100%.
After his scare-tactics I politely asked if I could ask a question and he said
yes. Here's more or less how the conversation went from there:

me:
    So... what do you know about me?  Do you know anything about me like...
    where I live?  [This seemed like a pretty straight forward question for
    literally any government employee looking at a report about you]
KB: [angry]
    Is there somebody there with you?  Who is there with you?  Who
    is listening to this conversation with you?
me: [Oh shit.  He caught me.  Oh wait, there was nothing to catch]
    I assure you, there is nobody around.  I'm walking down the street and
    literally can't see anybody.
KB:
    I heard whispers.  Who was that whispering?
me:
    I don't know what to tell you Kevin.  There really isn't anybody here with
    me.
KB:
    I would really like to move forward.  I do not need to provide these
    details to you at this time.
me: [cutting the foreplay]
    How do I know this isn't a scam?
KB:
    Can you provide your debit card information?
me:
    HELL NO you cannot have my bank account information!
KB:
    Calm down!  That is not what I asked!
me:
    Yes it is!  That is exactly what you asked for!
KB: [Sounding genuinely annoyed]
    I did not ask for that.  I did not ask for any of your information banking
    information.  Did I just ask for you debit, credit, or bank account
    information?
me:
    YES!

\*click\*

And with that, Kevin hung up on me. I was a changed man in that moment. I was
on the lamb, running from the most menacing branch of the United States
Government: *The IRS*. I think I'm going to change my last name to Bourne
tomorrow, it only seems fitting.

Manipulating people into giving you their money is a deplorable crime against
humanity.  Scams are terrible and feed off of those who already have it tough
enough.

    *Fuck scammers.*

If the IRS is auditing you they will just send you mail for *months* and will
never call you.  Despite how it may feel sometimes, they are actually in the
business of **making** money and not in the business of tricking you or making
your life a living hell.

If you get any threating calls from any agency of authority ask some *basic*
questions like

- Say my [*full*] name.
- Tell me my address.
- What and when exactly did this problem come up?

    Stay vigilant and don't fall for stuff like this.
