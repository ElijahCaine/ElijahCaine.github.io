Bo Burnham: Make Happy
======================

Numerous commentary on the music industry,
  - Genuine appreciation for all artists.
  - Contempt for fake artists and 'sellouts'

Attempting to reconcile success with feelings of becoming the thing you hate
   - (sellouts cited above).
   - 200$ cannon joke.
   - Straight talk toward the end of the show.

Attempting to distance self from audience. Possible self-destructive behavior.
    - Explains jokes / disclaims jokes.
    - Personal problems, depression, reactions to fame.
    - He did take a *looong* break from popularity for a while for X reasons,
      came back, can't really say I'm surprised by the fact that he would have
      a hard time in the lime-light *again*.

I can't really say I *enjoyed* this show, but it got me to think. Especially
compared with 'What' a few years back, this wasn't nearly as entertaining, but
this show got me to write a blogpost so it was doing *something* right.
