Experience
----------

*Five Points* was an enjoyable place to work. I'd guess the patron demographics
were spilt evenly between working on laptops, having a meeting, and just
getting a cup of coffee to go. The music was a point of pride for the staff as
it was a way to show off their authentic vinyl collection; while the music
sounded fine I opted to listen to my own music since their selection wasn't my
taste.

The location was split into two rooms, both with ample seating and one with the
baristas. I spent the first half my day at the front, window-facing, bar and
the second half at a table-for-two near an outlet because laptops need
power.

I'm new to this so I'm not comfortable definitively saying that this is a good
or bad place to work at. I was able to get things done for four hours and only
left because I was hungry and cheap. I wasn't pestered to leave at any point
and they passed my *"Adequate Cup of Black Coffee"* test. The neighborhood is
busy but quiet, and there's some good people-watching subjects if you're
interested in that sort of thing...

... for instance a guy walked in wearing some sick Geordi La Forge.

That was pretty great.
