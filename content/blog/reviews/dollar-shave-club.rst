Initial Impressions on Dollar Shave Club
========================================

    **TLDR: The Dollar Shave Club 4X Raxor is a solid razor at a fair price.**

I bit the bullet. I joined `Dollar Shave Club`_.

I usually consider myself a fairly frugal person.  Not to the extent that I
crawl forums and cut coupons *for the thrill of the deal*, but I will usually
eat in before eating out, and I'll definitely use the same crappy razor for
*months* if I can get away with it.

So why did I join Dollar Shave Club?  To answer that I must reveal the *deep
dark secret* that **I shave my legs**.  I wouldn't consider it a huge part of
my identity; it's just a thing I do to cure post-shower-itchy-legs [1]_.  I
started late in High School, stopped for the first few years of college for
whatever reason, and recently picked it back up.  I tried using some cheap
razor I bought but it wasn't getting the job done.  Legs were just too big a
job for this cheap razor to handle.  I took a hard look in the mirror at
myself, my bad facial-hair, and my terribly shaven legs.  **I decided it was
time**.

The ads had worked and the price was right so I bought the **The 4x**.
Here's what was in the box:

The packaging was thoughtfully compact [2]_.  I would compare the experience
of opening the box to unpacking a new smart-phone or laptop in that I could
tell *my experience was well planned*.  There was a clear and intentional
aesthetic design put into the box and the layout of it's contents.  I didn't
expect a box with random shaving implements strewn about, but I wasn't
expected a well crafted package either.  It was fun.

I'm not sure what to say about a razor since I don't consider myself an
aficionado on the topic.  What I can say with confidence is that *this
particular razor* is **a solid razor at a reasonable price**.  In shaving my
legs I didn't cut myself once, and shaving my face was a pleasant enough
experience.  I wasn't blown away by the razor, but I don't think that's Dollar
Shave Club's intention.  It wasn't *the closest shave of my life*, but it was
a solid experience and I'm gonna keep my subscription.

**PS**: I tried the sample of **Easy Shave Butter** and it was an experiment,
but some soap and water gets the job done just fine for me.  I can really take
it or leave it.  Like I said earlier, I'm frugal so *what works for me* is
usually what I go for.

    I was not paid by by Dollar Shave Club (or anybody else) to write this
    post.  I *wish* I got paid to write random reviews.  **That'd be
    awesome.**

.. Footnotes
.. [1]  Starting in high-school when I got out of the shower my legs would
        itch like a mother-cusser.  I got the idea to try shaving my legs to
        see if that would help and *immediately* my condition was cured.

.. [2] I don't order a lot of packages, but the ones I get are usually from
       Amazon, a company that seems to love packaging small things in large
       boxes.
