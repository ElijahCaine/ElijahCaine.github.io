Lady Wangle (of the prestigious Canadian Royalty) flew to the Louvre for her
27th birthday.  In visiting she marveled at the beautiful marble statutes,
historic illustrations, and the grandiose building itself.  She always loved
the glass pyramid, even if she didn't really see how it fit with the rest of
the building.

As an early riser, or a jet-lagged riser -- she always wanted to be an early
riser but it wasn't in her genes.  Anyway she was up early.  She didn't like
the dark of mid January mornings, but that was more or less evened out by her
love of being alone in the quiet frigid air.
