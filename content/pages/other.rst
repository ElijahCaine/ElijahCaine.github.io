I'm really not sure this deserves it's own page, but here's a list of

A List of Awesome Things!\*
===========================

This is an ever growing list of some things which I believe are the bees knees and are 100% worth sharing.

\* Curated by myself, Elijah.

Programming is a pretty broad topic, with a huge range of guides and helpful
information. Here's a list of resources I find to be especially useful.

`Why's Poignant guide to Ruby`_
-------------------------------

I'm not a particularly big fan of Ruby, but I do enjoy this guide. For
anybody looking for an introduction to programming at large or Ruby
specifically, this is a great place to start.

`Learn you a Haskell for Great Good`_
-------------------------------------

For something completely different, LyaHfGG is a great guide to Haskell as
well as Functional Programming. Not as goofy as Why's Poignant guide, but a
great introduction into a few new paradigms.

`Clojure for the Brave and True`_
---------------------------------

Just as the above guides, this book is very fun to read, accessible to a
large range of audiences, and is of course a great place to start learning with
Clojure.
