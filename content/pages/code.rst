Below is a curated list of my development endeavors:

`TimeSync-Node`_
----------------

A `NodeJS`_ based project for keeping track of time for internal and externally
funded projects at the `Open Source Lab`_. Uses `ExpressJS`_, `KnexJS`_
libraries and a `Postgres`_ backend.

My part in this project was largely in the design of the `TimeSync API`_ and in
the implementation of the actual backends; myself and a team of coworkers
worked on this part time to get it implemented in about six months, including a
full unit-test suite, compatibility with sqlite, and a thorough set of
documentation.

`HuRandom`_
-----------

A Python `Flask`_ webapp with a `Sqlite`_ backend built to collect data in the
pursuit of answering the question "When people think of a *random number* what
do they usually come up with?"

The short answer: Usually something between 1 and 100.

`go-to-zzz`_
------------

A simple `Golang`_ application for calculating when one should go to sleep. Not
the most exciting application on the planet, but it gave me an excute to write
some Go.
