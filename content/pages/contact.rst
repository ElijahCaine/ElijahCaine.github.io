:summary: How to reach me.
:url: contact/

I can best be reached in the following ways:

* Email: ``elijahCaineMV@gmail.com``. I'm still working on getting my own mail on this domain setup.
* IRC: I'm `pop` on `irc.freenode.net`.
* Github: `ElijahCaine`_. It's basically my twitter. Follow me there to see exciting stuff I do, like `this blog~`_

*I dont want to say I don't "do" other social media like Twitter and Facebook, but I really just don't check anything except the above on a regular basis.*

Feel free to hit me up on any of those mediums.
We can get a beer or something when we're in the same city.
