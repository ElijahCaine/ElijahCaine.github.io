I have been employed by the OSU Open Source Lab as a developer since the spring
of 2014. In that time I have been able to do a ton of great things including:

* Attend and present at conferences.
* Learn vital development skills for my career
* Mentor other OSL devs and Google Summer of Code students.
* Work with some very smart and interesting people.

Projects I have worked on at the lab include:

* `Timesync-Node`_, as an API designer and implementer.
* `Protein Geometry Database`_, as a codebase maintainer and GSOC mentor.
* `Devops Bootcamp`_, as a curriculum designer and teacher.
