I have been a devoted member of the `Oregon State University Linux Users
Group`_ my freshman year in 2013.

In 2014 I was elected LUG President and have since devoted time, energy, and
resources into making a great club even better. We host events such as:

* **Install Festival** in which we help new and veteran Linux users install and use
  Linux in a Virtual Machine, Dual Boot, in the Cloud, or in a full
  installation.
* **speakers and presentations** including hosting a `CoreOS`_
  recruiting event, and various 'Practice Run' talks people give before
  presenting at large conferences.
* **Hackathons** at which we spend an hour furiously typing to solve coding riddles
  and conundrums for a grand prize of *stickers*.
* **Languages Night** where we host a round-table discussion about Open Source
  Software, Programming, and LUG related topics at large.

If you are interested in attending, check out the `LUG website`_ for time and
location details. If you would like to hang out with our community online,
check out the ``#osu-lug`` IRC channel on Freenode.
