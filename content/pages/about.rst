Who *is* Elijah?
----------------

Here's some stuff you can ask me about, in no particular order.

I'm an aspiring...

- Writer.
- Game developer.
- Film Maker.
- Programmer.
- Magical DevOps cloud wizard.
- Open Source advocate.
- Container orchestration buzzword expert.
- Networking. Just networking.

I have done...

- School at Oregon State University (OSU).
- A bunch of talks at conferences like SeaGL, SCALE, and Write the Docs EU.

I have worked at...

- The `OSU Open Source Lab`_ as a developer during school.
- `CoreOS`_ as a documentation writer working part time during school.
- `Nordstrom`_ as a DevOps Engineer in their intern program. Yes [really]_.

I've gotten a *lot* out of each of these including...

- I learned how to learn.
- I learned how to work well with others.
- I did little bit of programming here and there too.
